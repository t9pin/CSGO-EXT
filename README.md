`ESP is customizable, supporting skeleton and rainbow visuals, and shows enemy location, hitbox, and what team they're on.`

### STEPS

[NOTE] This file is NOT signed by Windows OS, So to many this may show up as an "unsafe" file. All you need to do if this happens is press More Info>Run Anyway. Before you begin with any of these steps, I strongly advise that you turn off Antivirus (AV) applications. AV WILL most likely delete critical game injection files if not turned off.

[1] Disable all Windows AV. (AV WILL flag this cheat!)

[2] Download and unzip (extract) the folder into any directory.

[3] Launch extcsgo.exe BEFORE opening CSGO.

[4] Launch CSGO and load into desired game-mode, then press the inspect key.

[5] You should be good to go! Please fork or star this mini-project to support me! :D

`Although this cheat is undetected, I would advise either using an alt account or inserting your own driver.`
